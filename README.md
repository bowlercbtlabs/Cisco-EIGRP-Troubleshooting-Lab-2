# Cisco EIGRP Troubleshooting - Lab 2

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- You have given your network administrator the task of configuring EIGRP between R1 and R2. After several hours of trying to figure out why the EIGRP neighbor relationship is not forming, your network administrator has come to you for help.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 and R2 form an EIGRP neighbor relationship and that you can ping from 1.1.1.1 to 2.2.2.2 with no
issues.
- You may not change any configuration on R1 to complete this task

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After you have restored the above connectivity, you realize that a recently fired employee may have caused issues with your network which is creating instability in your network. Host 1.1.1.1 is complaining that they cannot ping host 4.4.4.4.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that host 1.1.1.1 can ping host 4.4.4.4. R4 should also see all routes advertised by R1 with their correct subnet mask information.
